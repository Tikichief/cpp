Vector Resize

Commonly, the size of a list of items is not known during a program's compile time. Thus, a vector's size need not be specified in the 
vector's declaration. Instead, a vector's size can be set or changed while a program executes using resize(N). Ex: highScore.resize(10) 
resizes the highScores vector to have 10 elements.

resize() can be called multiple times. If the new size is larger, resize() adds elements at the end. If smaller, resize() deletes 
elements from the end. If userScores has size 3 (elements 0, 1, 2), userScores.resize(2); would delete element 2, leaving elements 
0 and 1. A subsequent access to userScores.at(2) would result in an error.

Ex:

vector<int> carSales;

// carSales.at(0) = 122; Would be out-of-range error

carSales.resize(3);

carSales.at(0) = 122;
carSales.at(1) = 11; 
carSales.at(2) = 7;
