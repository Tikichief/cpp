/*
6.2.3: Printing array elements with a for loop.
Write three statements to print the first three elements of array runTimes. Follow each statement with a newline. Ex: If runTime = 
{800, 775, 790, 805, 808}, print:
800 
775 
790
Note: These activities may test code with different test values. This activity will perform two tests, the first with a 5-element array 
(int runTimes[5]), the second with a 4-element array (int runTimes[4]). See "How to Use zyBooks". . 
Also note: If the submitted code tries to access an invalid array element, such as runTime[9] for a 5-element array, the test may 
generate strange results. Or the test may crash and report "Program end never reached", in which case the system doesn't print the 
test case that caused the reported message.
