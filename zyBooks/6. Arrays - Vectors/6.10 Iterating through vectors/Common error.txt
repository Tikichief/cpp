Common error: Accessing out of range vector element

A common error is to try to access a vector with an index that is out of the vector's index range. Ex: Trying to access highScores.at(8)
when highScores valid indices are 0-7. Care should be taken whenever a user enters a number that is then used as a vector index, and 
when using a loop index as a vector index also, to ensure the array index is within a vector's valid index range. Accessing an index that
is out of range causes the program to automatically abort execution, typically with an error message being automatically printed. For 
example, for the declaration vector highScores(8), accessing highScores.at(8), or highScores.at(i) where i is 8, yields the following 
error message when running the program compiled with g++:
