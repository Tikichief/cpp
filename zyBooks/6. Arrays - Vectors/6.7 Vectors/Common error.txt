Common error: Forgetting to include <vector>

A common error is to forget the #include <vector> at the top of the file when using vectors. Trying to then declare a vector variable 
may yield a strange compiler error message, such as:

$ g++ -Wall testfile.cpp
testfile.cpp:12: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of vector with no type
testfile.cpp:12: error: expected ; before < token

The same error message may be seen if the vector library is included but the namespace std is not used.
