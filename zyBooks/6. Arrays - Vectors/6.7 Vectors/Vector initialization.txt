Vector initialization

A vector's elements are automatically initialized to 0s during the vector declaration.

All of a vector's elements may be initialized to another single value. Ex: vector<int> myVector(3, -1); creates a vector named 
myVector with three elements, each with value -1.

A programmer may initialize each vector element with different values by specifying the initial values in braces {} separated by commas. 
Ex: vector<int> carSales = {5, 7, 11}; creates a vector of three integer elements initialized with values 5, 7, and 11. Such vector 
declaration and initialization does not require specifying the vector size, because the vector's size is automatically set to the number of 
elements within the braces. For a larger vector, initialization may be done by first declaring the vector, and then using a loop to assign vector 
elements.
