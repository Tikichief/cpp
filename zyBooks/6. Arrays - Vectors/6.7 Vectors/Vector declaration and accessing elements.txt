Vector declaration and accessing elements

A programmer commonly needs to maintain a list of items, just as people often maintain lists of items like a grocery list or a course roster. 
A vector is an ordered list of items of a given data type. Each item in a vector is called an element. A programmer must include the statement 
#include <vector> at the top of the file when planning to use vectors.

Construct 6.7.1: Vector declaration.
vector<dataType> vectorName(numElements);


The statement above declares a vector with the specified number of elements, each element of the specified data type. The type of each 
vector element is specified within the angle brackets (<>). The number of vector elements is specified within parentheses following the 
vector name. Ex: vector<int> gameScores(4); declares a vector gamesScores with 4 integer elements.

Terminology note: { } are braces. < > are angle brackets, or chevrons. In a vector access, the number in .at() parentheses is called the index 
of the corresponding element. The first vector element is at index 0.

If you have studied arrays, then know that a vector was added to C++ as a safer and more powerful form of arrays, discussed elsewhere.
