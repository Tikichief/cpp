Using an expression for a vector index

A powerful aspect of vectors is that the index is an expression. Ex: userNums.at(i) uses the value held in the int variable i as the index. 
As such, a vector is useful to easily lookup the Nth item in a list.

A vector's index must be an integer type. The vector index cannot be a floating-point type, even if the value is 0.0, 1.0, etc.

The program below allows a user to print the age of the Nth oldest known person to have ever lived. The program quickly accesses the Nth 
oldest person's age using oldestPeople.at(nthPerson - 1). Note that the index is nthPerson - 1 rather than just nthPerson 
because a vector's indices start at 0, so the 1st age is at index 0, the 2nd at index 1, etc.
