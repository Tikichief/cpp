/*
5.2.3: Basic while loop expression.
Write a while loop that prints userNum divided by 2 (integer division) until reaching 1. 
Follow each number by a space. Example output for userNum = 40: 

20 10 5 2 1

Note: These activities may test code with different test values. This activity will perform four tests, with userNum = 40, 
then with userNum = 2, then with userNum = 0, then with userNum = -1. 
Also note: If the submitted code has an infinite loop, the system will stop running the code after a few seconds, 
and report "Programend never reached." The system doesn't print the test case that caused the reported message.
