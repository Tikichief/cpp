/*
1.	Write a program demonstrates the ++ and −− operators. Use prefix and postfix mode for same variable  
This is my variable = 7
your output should look like the example.
Example is 
Now the variable num is 5 
I will increment num again. 
Now the variable num is 6 
I will now decrement num. 
Now the variable num is 5 
I will decrement num again. 
Now the variable num is 4

A)	x = 2;

B)	x = 2;

C)	x = 2;
